# Time tracking web app

## Objective
We would like you to imagine yourself as a startup solo founder,
who wants to create an intuitive time-tracking web app that will 
be used by users (mostly software developers) to track the amount of time that they spent on various tasks and see reports about their velocity.

## Before we start
We kindly ask you to not try to deliver all features proposed in this assignment and 
instead timebox the whole implementation process to 4-6 hours. Instead of trying to do everything - please concentrate on features that you consider the most crucial for the final user.

Also, do not be shy to replace some of our proposed features with your own, that you consider more important.

Please submit the results of your work within agreed timeline and please email us if you would like to have more time.

## Expected behavior

You want your users to be able to:
- [ ] Create a task
  - [ ] Give the task a name during the creation
  - [ ] Select task type - Story or Bug
  - [ ] Enter how much time they spent on task
  - [ ] Enter dates on which they were working on a task, if empty - the current date should be pre-filled
  - [ ] Add 0 to 3 labels/tags

- [ ] See the list of previously created tasks
  - [ ] export a list of created tasks as JSON file
  - [ ] import a list of tasks as JSON file

- [ ] Edit a task
  - [ ] edit any field of the task
  - [ ] delete task
  
- [ ] See the dashboard with insights about tasks
  - [ ] see the amount of bugs completed last week and the difference in % compared to previous week
  - [ ] see the amount of stories completed last week and the difference in % compared to previous week
  - [ ] see time spent on stories and bugs last week and the difference in % compared to previous week
  - [ ] see the line chart that shows time spent per week on stories and bugs

- [ ] Be able to clean localstorage, cookies, all website data, restart the browser and still see all their data available 
- [ ] Anything else that you would like to add

## Technical requirements
- [ ] Please use **React** for your web app
- [ ] We trust you to use any other tools/libraries to your best taste. Our advice will be: NextJS and Typescript
- [ ] Provide some type of API for your client (we expect that tasks will be stored on your backend, but DB is not required, feel free to do something simple - like global variables or anything that works for you)
- [ ] You have full freedom in terms of UI/UX, we trust you to organaze widgets and pages in way that you consider best.


## Evaluation Criteria
-   TS/JS best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   Completeness: what features did you complete? We expect at least 3 major features
-   Product: Ability to prioritize in order to deliver maximum business value
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?
